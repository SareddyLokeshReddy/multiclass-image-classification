I developed this project to solve a common problem in image classification systems — forced misclassification.
Most models predict an image as one of the trained classes even when the image does not belong to any of them.

















#🚀 Deployment
🔗 Live Application:
🚀 **Deployment Link**  
👉 [Live Streamlit App](https://multiclass-image-classification-c8ccgekd37syxs4aztpqgt.streamlit.app/)


After training, I deployed the model using Streamlit Cloud.
The web application allows users to:

Upload an image
View the predicted class
See confidence scores
Understand how the model behaves for unknown inputs

#🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
