Multiclass Image Classification with Unknown Detection
📌 About the Project

I developed this project to solve a common problem in image classification systems — forced misclassification.
Most models predict an image as one of the trained classes even when the image does not belong to any of them.

To solve this, I built a multiclass image classification model with an explicit UNKNOWN class.
The model can correctly classify cats, dogs, and horses, and it predicts UNKNOWN for any image that does not belong to these classes, such as humans, vehicles, or objects.

🎯 Motivation

While testing basic classifiers, I noticed that images like a teapot or a human face were being incorrectly classified as animals.
Instead of using confidence thresholds, I decided to train the model with an additional UNKNOWN class so it can learn to reject unrelated images.

This approach makes the model more realistic and production-ready.












#Model Performance

Training Accuracy: ~90%
Validation Accuracy: ~85%
Correctly identifies:
Animal images → Cat, Dog, Horse
Non-animal images → UNKNOWN
The model no longer forces unrelated images into known classes.

#🚀 Deployment
🔗 Live Application:
🚀 **Deployment Link**  
👉 [Live Streamlit App](https://multiclass-image-classification-c8ccgekd37syxs4aztpqgt.streamlit.app/)


After training, I deployed the model using Streamlit Cloud.
The web application allows users to:
